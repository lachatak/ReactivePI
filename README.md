Reactive PI
===========

Reactive PI is a library based on akka and scala that allows
developers to use the various I/O ports on their raspberry
PI in a reactive manner. 

## Planned features
Support is planned for the following I/O ports/protocols:

- I2C
- SPI
- GPIO

## Development status
I'm working on getting a basic API layed out.
Also, I don't have a good way to test things, this needs
work as well to make my life easier.

Please keep an eye out on this repo to get more news
as things progress
